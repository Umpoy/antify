# Antify

Antify is a personal project created to backfire a viral Cenafy extension prank. Using a manifest.json I was able to turn vanilla JavaScript into a localized Google Chrome extension.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser (or Chromium-based browser)
- Basic understanding of Chrome Extensions [link](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world)
